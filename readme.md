# Project Description
###### Project Name: Self Care Trip Guide Maps
The aim of this lab was to produce a simple web map and editing map features such as symbology and text. This lab also served as an opportunity to use css styling features along with javascript language as well as the leaflet library.

Some of the major functions conducted in the lab was downloading routes from google maps and converting them into a file using Maps to GPX that we later on renamed as a javascript file in atom and loaded into our html document. We later on used GeoJSON to make some changes to texts on the placemarkers and what text appeared on the final map.

In terms of stylistic features, I changed the dashes, weight, opacity and color of the map route. I also changed the color of the text box borders that provide context for what the map is showing. I included author credits as well as citations for my map.
